Person detection and person re-identification
are rapidly increasing research areas in computer vision.
%
They are independent but related. In fact, the output of person detection 
is the input of person re-identification. There are a certain
number of solutions for each of these two individual tasks. But currently,
there is no existing solution that can combine them to form an
integrated working pipeline.

To fill the gap, we propose a highly modular and structural framework
solution that provides the functionalities including not only cross-language
invocation and pipeline execution mechanism but also viewer, device, tracker,
detector, and recognizer abstraction.
%
We instantiate the proposed framework to
achieve our goal of tracking the same person across multiple
cameras, which essentially is the combination of person detection
and person re-identification.
Besides the main task of person re-identification, we also support skeleton 
tracking, as well as camera calibration, image alignment and green screen image 
which commonly comes with a computer vision framework.
%
We evaluate our proposed solution according to the requirements and usage
scenarios and report the major metrics used by the research community for
person detection and person re-identification tasks, respectively.
