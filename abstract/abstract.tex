\begin{abstract}
Person detection, person re-identification, each on their
own, is a rapidly increasing and independent research task of
computer vision.
%
In fact, the output from person detection is naturally the input
of person re-identification task, which indicates that these two
tasks are highly related, even though there are a certain
number of solutions for each of the individual sub-tasks. But currently,
there is no existing solution that can combine them to form a
integrated working pipeline.

To fill the gap, we propose a highly modular and structural framework
solution that provides the functionalities of cross-language
invocation, pipeline execution mechanism, viewer, device, tracker,
detector and recognizer abstraction.
%
We instantiate the proposed framework to
achieve our goal of tracking the same person across multiple
cameras, which essentially is the combination of person detection
and person re-identification.
With our framework instance, we also support skeleton tracking, as well as camera
calibration, image alignment and green screen image which commonly
comes with a computer vision framework.
%
We evaluate our solution first from the framework point of view
according to the requirements and scenarios then also report the
major metrics used by the research community for person detection
and person re-identification tasks respectively.
