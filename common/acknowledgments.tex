During the time I was working on this thesis, I was lucky enough to 
get help, suggestion and advice from many people. I would like to 
firstly offer my sincere gratitude to my co-supervisors Dr.~Joey Paquet 
and Dr.~Serguei Mokhov for their indispensable 
supervision and guidance. 
Also, I need to say thank you to my lab mates, Yiran Shen, Jashanjot 
Singh and Jyotsana Gupta for their valuable suggestions.
Besides that I would like to thank my whole family, especially my parents Yong
Lai and Qin Luo for their support and understanding.

During the time I was working on my MSc degree, I was fortunate enough to 
know many good friends in this beautiful city --- Montreal.
I would like to express my great gratitude to them for their 
encouragement and companionship. They are: Yixin Yao, Outong Li, Chen Feng, 
Xingjian Zhang, Bo Li, Qinwei Luo, Jingye Hou, and Jing Yang.

Lastly, I also need to say thank you to my friends who are not in 
Montreal but in my hometown Guangzhou. Even though with such long distance and
12 hours jet-lag, when I was depressed or felt stressed, I still could
get their greeting and phone call frequently. They are: Zijian Kong,
Haien Long, and Xuyi Huang.
